File: _INSTRUCTIONS.txt
Database: TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (TUSZ)
Version: 1.5.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simplified version of the TUSZ Corpus. This release contains
two things: edf files and annotation files.

The edf files are located in the directoy name "./edf". You can easily
locate them using find:

 find . -name "*.edf"

The annotation files are stored here:

 _DOCS/ref_train.txt => training data
 _DOCS/ref_dev.txt => dev data

There is also a held-out eval set that is not included in this release.

The annotation files contain records of the form:

 00000492_s003_t000 0.0000 6.2825 bckg 1.0000
 00000492_s003_t000 6.2825 35.8875 seiz 1.0000

The first field is the unique basename of an edf file:

nedc_000_[1]: find . -name "*00000492_s003_t000.edf"
./edf/train/01_tcp_ar/004/00000492/s003_2003_07_18/00000492_s003_t000.edf

The second two fields are the start and stop times of the event
respectively. The next field is the label ("seiz" or "bckg"). The last
field is the confidence(which is always 1.0 for manually labeled
data).

Before you attempt to process the data, please review the following
papers that describe the data:

 _DOCS/00_dbeeg.pdf: An overview of the corpus
 _DOCS/01_elect.pdf: An overview of how the data is stored in an edf file
 _DOCS/02_annot.pdf: A description of how we annotated the data (unfinished)
 _DOCS/03_score.pdf: An overview of the scoring algorithm

Demonstration software that reads edf files in Python is located here:
